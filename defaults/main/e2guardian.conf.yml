# Log Exception Hits
# Log if an exception (user, ip, URL, phrase) is matched and so
# the page gets let through.  Can be useful for diagnosing
# why a site gets through the filter.
# 0 = never log exceptions
# 1 = log exceptions, but do not explicitly mark them as such
# 2 = always log & mark exceptions (default)

# used in arrays so that combined logs show originating server.
# 5 = Protex format
# Protex format type 6 Same format as above but system name field is blank

# Proxy timeout
# Set tcp timeout between the Proxy and e2guardian

# Banned image replacement
# Images that are banned due to domain/url/etc reasons including those

# Filter groups options
# filtergroups sets the number of filter groups. A filter group is a set of content
# filtering options you can apply to a group of users.  The value must be 1 or more.
# e2guardian will automatically look for e2guardianfN.conf where N is the filter
# group.  To assign users to groups use the filtergroupslist option.  All users default
# to filter group 1.  You must have some sort of authentication to be able to map users
# to a group.

# Weighted phrase mode
# There are 3 possible modes of operation:
# 0 = off = do not use the weighted phrase feature.
# 1 = on, normal = normal weighted phrase operation.
# 2 = on, singular = each weighted phrase found only counts once on a page.
#
# IMPORTANT: Note that setting this to "0" turns off all features which
# extract phrases from page content, including banned & exception
# phrases (not just weighted), search term filtering, and scanning for
# links to banned URLs.

# Smart, Raw and Meta/Title phrase content filtering options
# Smart is where the multiple spaces and HTML are removed before phrase filtering
# Raw is where the raw HTML including meta tags are phrase filtered
# Meta/Title is where only meta and title tags are phrase filtered (v. quick)
# CPU usage can be effectively halved by using setting 0 or 1 compared to 2
# 0 = raw only
# 1 = smart only
# 2 = both of the above (default)
# 3 = meta/title
