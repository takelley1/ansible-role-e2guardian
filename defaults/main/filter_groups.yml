# Example dictionary specifying filter groups and list overrides.
e2g_filter_groups:

  # The first group defined will be the default group for all
  #   hosts that aren't matched by any other group.
  # See the example variables in `defaults/main/lists` to define filtering rules
  #   for this group.
  #
  # All lists that AREN'T defined for groups >1 will default to using the
  #   list defined for group 1.
  # For example, group `foo` doesn't have the `contentregexplist` defined,
  #   therefore it will default to using the `e2g_contentregexplist` variable
  #   defined for group 1 in defaults/main/lists/contentregexplist.yml.
