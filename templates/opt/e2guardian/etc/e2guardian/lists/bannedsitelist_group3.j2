#domains in banned list
#Don't bother with the www. or the http://
#
#The bannedurllist is for blocking PART of a site
#The bannedsitelist is for blocking ALL of a site
#
#NOTE: Sites using just IP should be put into bannedsiteiplist
#
#You can include
#.tld so for example you can match .gov for example
#
#The 'grey' lists override the 'banned' lists.
#The 'exception' lists override the 'banned' lists also.
#The difference is that the 'exception' lists completely switch
#off *all* other filtering for the match.  'grey' lists only
#stop the URL filtering and allow the normal filtering to work.
#
#An example of grey list use is when in Blanket Block (whitelist)
#mode and you want to allow some sites but still filter as normal
#on their content
#
#Another example of grey list use is when you ban a site but want
#to allow part of it.
#
#To include additional files in this list use this example:
#.Include</usr/local/etc/e2guardian/anotherbannedurllist>
#
#You can have multiple .Includes.
#
# Time limiting syntax:
# #time: <start hour> <start minute> <end hour> <end minute> <days>
# Example:
##time: 9 0 17 0 01234
# Remove the first # from the line above to enable this list only from
# 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.
#
# List categorisation
#listcategory: "Banned Sites"
#
#List other sites to block:
# NOTE: From v5 Blanket blocks are now implimented using Storyboarding
# WARNING: Old style Blanket blocks in this file will be silently ignored
#
#
# The squidGuard advert domain/URL lists are now included by default.
# To work with advanced ad blocking & the logadblocks option, advert
# phrase/site/URL lists should have the string "ADs" in their listcategory.
