#URLs in banned list
#Don't bother with the http:// or the www
#
#The bannedurllist is for blocking PART of a site
#The bannedsitelist is for blocking ALL of a site
#
#The 'grey' lists override the 'banned' lists.
#The 'exception' lists override the 'banned' lists also.
#The difference is that the 'exception' lists completely switch
#off *all* other filtering for the match.  'grey' lists only
#stop the URL filtering and allow the normal filtering to work.
#
#An example of grey list use is when in Blanket Block (whitelist)
#mode and you want to allow some sites but still filter as normal
#on their content
#
#Another example of grey list use is when you ban a site but want
#to allow part of it.
#
#To include additional files in this list use this example:
#.Include<{{ e2g_install_dir }}/etc/e2guardian/anotherbannedurllist>
#
#You can have multiple .Includes.
#listcategory: "Banned URLs"
#List other URLs to block:
# members.home.net/uporn
